This allows for the manipulation of tracks outside the normal grid boundries for Parkitect. This allows for the direct manipulate of the indvidual curves of any track segment in the game.

## Controls

- left-click drag - will move a track piece in the horizontal plane
- left-click left-ctrl drag - will move the node in the vertical position only 
- right click - will select a dot and make it active
- alt + 1-9 - grid for moving nodes

In the mod folder there is a config.json that can modified to change the key bindings for the vertical drag.
